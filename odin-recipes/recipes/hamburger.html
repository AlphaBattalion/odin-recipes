<h2>Brief Description</h2>
<p>A hamburger is <strong>the</strong> food that defines the United States.<br> It is a beef patty with a bread bun on the top and bottom <br>of it, typically adorned with ketchup, relish, mustard, tomatoes,<br> lettuce, and anything else you fancy.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound (450 grams) ground beef chuck or ground</li>
  <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Butter, as needed</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Take the beef out of the refrigerator and allow it to <br>sit at room temperature for about 5 minutes before forming<br> the patties. Form beef into three 5 to 6 ounce hamburger patties.<br> Use your thumb to imprint a dimple into the middle of each<br> burger. (This prevents the middle of the burgers from puffing up<br> while cooking). Season both sides of the hamburgers<br> with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a cast iron pan over medium heat.<br> Cook hamburger patties 3 to 4 minutes on each side, depending<br> on how well done you like it.</li>
    <li>Rest burgers covered loosely with aluminum foil for 5 minutes <br> then serve on a buttered bun with lettuce, tomatoes and onion <br>(or how you like it).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
