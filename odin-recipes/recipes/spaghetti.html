<h2>Brief Description</h2>
<p>Spaghetti is an italian noodle dish often served with tomato sauce. <br> It is most commonly served with meatballs or meat sauce.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 pound lean ground meat like beef, turkey, chicken or lamb</li>
  <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
  <li>1 cup (130 grams) chopped onion</li>
  <li>3 garlic cloves, minced (1 tablespoon)</li>
  <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
  <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
  <li>Pinch crushed red pepper flakes</li>
  <li>1 cup water, broth or dry red wine</li>
  <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
  <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper</li>
  <li>Handful fresh basil leaves, plus more for serving</li>
  <li>12 ounces dried spaghetti or favorite pasta shape</li>
  <li>1/2 cup shredded parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). <br>Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks,<br> use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
    <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, <br> about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the garlic, tomato paste, oregano, and red pepper flakes and cook, <br> stirring continuously for about 1 minute..</li>
    <li>Pour in the water and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of meat <br>or onion stuck to the bottom of the pot. Stir in the tomatoes, 3/4 teaspoon of salt,<br> and a generous pinch of black pepper. Bring the sauce to a low simmer. Cook,<br> uncovered, at a low simmer for 25 minutes. As it cooks, stir and taste the sauce<br> a few times so you can adjust the seasoning accordingly</li>
    <li>About 15 minutes before the sauce finishes cooking, bring a large pot of salted <br>water to the boil, and then cook pasta according to package directions, but check<br> for doneness a minute or two before the suggested cooking time.</li>
    <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta,<br> and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, <br>and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Enjoy!</h2>
